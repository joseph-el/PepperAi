## Overview

PepperAI is an innovative project designed to enhance human-robot interaction using cutting-edge technology. By leveraging Kotlin and the Pepper SDK, this application empowers the Pepper robot to seamlessly engage with users, answering inquiries and providing explanations. This project explores the intricacies of AI integration, microservice architecture, and user interface design.

## Features!


- **Human-Robot Interaction**: Developed an application that allows the Pepper robot to interact with users naturally.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Implemented two microservice containers to manage backend operations.
  - **Container 1**: Hosts a Flask server powered by Python, integrating AssemblyAI and WisperAI for speech-to-text functionalities.
  - **Container 2**: Utilizes FlowiseAI, an open-source low-code tool, to orchestrate customized LLM (Large Language Model) flows and AI agents.
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with OpenAI's API for generating responses.
- **Efficient Communication**: Utilizes Redis for message storage, ensuring efficient communication between users and the robot.
- **User Interface**: Crafted a user-friendly UI using Figma for an intuitive user experience.
