# Empathy Mapping with Pepper 
*Attention: this project is only available in German!*<br>

### About

An empathy map is a simple but very effective tool for compiling assessments 
of the perception and emotional world of your own target group.
This scenario was developed for the bachelor's degree in business administration.
Students fill out their own empathy map during the exercise. The exercise lasts ~35 minutes.

### How the program works

At the start of the exercise, Pepper explains what an empathy map is and what the empathy mapping process is used for.
Then the Pepper asks the students to fill in their own empathy map during the exercise. (These were distributed at the
beginning of the lesson.) After that, Pepper goes through the ten questions with the students.He gives the students 
enough time to fill their own empathy map. An acoustic signal warns the students when to start and finish the task. 
Pepper also makes several animations in between to entertain the students. 

### What do you need?

In addition to this program on your Pepper, you also need empathy maps for the students which they have to fill out.

### Plans of further development:

We currently have no plans to further develop the program.
